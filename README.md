## What do we create
Together we created a game about Christmas. The goal of the game is to save Christmas. Why? It's the time of the year again, in a couple of weeks it's Christmas. 
The idea is to make high or low tones to move the snowball to the left or right. But pay attention to the Christmas trees that you can not touch them or you lose a life. When catching Christmas balls you get a life.

## Used technologies
Pitch detection
Three.js

## How do you control it
To play the game you have to make high or low tones to control the snowball and try not to hit the trees.
