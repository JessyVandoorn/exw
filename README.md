School group assignment for Experimental Web

## What do we create
Together we created a game about Christmas. The goal of the game is to save Christmas. Why? It's the time of the year again.
The idea is to make high or low pitches to move the snowball to the left or to the right. But pay attention to the Christmas trees that you can not touch them or you lose a life. When catching Christmas balls you get a life.

## Used technologies
Pitch detection
Three.js

## How do you control it
To play the game you have to make high or low pitches to control the snowball and try not to hit a tree.
